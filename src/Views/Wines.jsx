            <Row>
            <Col>Acidity: Refers to the liveliness and crispness of the wine; the fresh, tart, and sour attributes of the wine. High acidity makes a wine taste too sharp and sour, and low acidity makes a wine flat with less defined flavors. Higher acidity also makes for a more crisp color, and lower acidity makes for a darker or muddier colored wine.</Col>
            <Col>Body: Describes how heavy or light a wine feels in your mouth; a tactile sensation describing a wines weight and fullness. A wine can be light, medium, or full bodied. Full bodied wines contain the highest alcohol content, and they are fuller in the mouth. Medium bodied wines are a perfect transition for people who want to try light wines with more fullness. Light bodied wines are delicate and lean, and they typically contain the lowest amount of alcohol content.</Col>
            <Col>Dry: Refers to a more bitter wine; opposite of sweet. Dry wines contain no residual sugar or sweetness.</Col>
            <Col>Tannins: The naturally occurring compounds in wine that leave a bitter, dry, and puckering feeling in the mouth; texture is used to describe the quality of tannins. High tannin wines are described as bitter and astringent. Tannins come from four primary sources: the grape skins, grape seeds, grape stems, and the wood barrels used during aging. Red wines typically have stronger tannins than white.</Col>
